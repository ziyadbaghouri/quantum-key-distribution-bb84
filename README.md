# Noise and Error Sensitivity in Quantum Cryptography (BB84)

This project investigates how channel noise and eavesdropping affect the Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) in the BB84 Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol.

## Objectives
- Simulate BB84 key exchange (Alice–Bob) in Python.
- Model channel noise (bit-flip / depolarizing) and intercept–resend eavesdropping.
- Measure and visualize QBER as a function of noise probability *p* and attack rate *q*.
- Highlight the security threshold region.
